2. Added smartphone data in it.

3. from the smartphone dataset i have created a dataset which consists of smartphones data which has 5g compatability.

4. smartphone dataset is present and using smartphone dataset we have created a 5g compatability dataset using jadbio

5. then i have analyzed dataset and here are the analysis reports

## 2. Using pycaret

PyCaret is an open-source machine learning library in Python that helps to automate many tasks in the machine learning workflow. It is especially useful for those who are new to data science or want to perform rapid prototyping. Here are some reasons why PyCaret is useful:

1.Simplicity and Ease of Use

2.Rapid Prototyping

3.End-to-End Workflow

4.Built-in Preprocessing

5. Model Comparison

6. Extensive Support for Models

7. Visualization

8. Integration with other Libraries

## 2b. Gradio

Gradio is a Python library that allows developers to rapidly generate user interfaces (UI) for machine learning models. So I have used gradio for the above pycaret dataset.
